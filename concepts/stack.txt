Stack is a linear homogeneous data structure in which insertion and deletion occurs from a particular end only that is top end.

While,

In an Array insertion and deletion can occur from both the ends i.e. top and bottom ends.

That's the basic difference between an Array and a Stack

Stack follows LIFO Principle i.e. Last In First Out ( Suppose there are 5 elements in a stack and 5 is the last element that is inserted in the stack and therefore it is the first element to be deleted and hence Last In First Out(LIFO))

The Basic Operations of Stack includes:

1)Push: Insertioon
2)Pop: Deletion
3)Peek: Display the top most elements
4)Display: Display all the elements

Peek is not so important as we generally display all the elements present in the stack we barely want to print only the top most element of the stack

We use a menu driven or switch case algo to perform stack operations as it's more efficient and better.

Applications of Stacks :

1)Parsing and Reversing
2)Used in Function Call and Interrupt
3)Recursion
4)To evaluate Prefix and Postfix Operations

Important Conditions:

1) Stack Overflow: When the stack length is full and no more elements cannot be entered then it's termed as Stack Overflow .
2) Stack Underflow: When the stack is empty i.e. there are no elements present in the stack then it's termed as Stack Underflow.

We genrally initialize top as -1 and increase it eventually by 1 ( top ++ )
